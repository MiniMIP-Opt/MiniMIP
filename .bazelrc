# TODO(lpawel): With c++20 or c++2a there was an error on 2023/10/03:
#
# /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/13/../../../../include/c++/13/chrono:2320:48:
# error: call to consteval function 'std::chrono::hh_mm_ss::_S_fractional_width'
# is not a constant expression
#
# This is likely due to old `clang` in my toolchain. Note, however, that OR-Tools
# are compatible with C++17 (and do not support C++20 yet). Hence, it's actually
# safer to stay with C++17 for a while (it shouldn't matter in practice that much
# anyway).
